# 📧 Spam Email Prediction Using Machine Learning

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In today's digital age, email communication is an essential tool for both personal and professional use. However, users are often overwhelmed with unwanted messages known as **spam**. These spam emails not only clutter inboxes but can also contain malicious content like phishing links or malware. Manually filtering such emails is inefficient and prone to errors.

**Objective:**  
To develop an intelligent machine learning system that can automatically classify email messages as **spam** or **not spam** (ham) based on their textual content. The goal is to help users keep their inbox clean and secure.

## 🧠 Project Objective

Build a spam detection model using natural language processing and classification algorithms to predict whether an incoming email is spam.

## 📝 Dataset Description

The dataset typically contains:

- **Label** – Email classification: `ham` (not spam) or `spam`
- **Message** – Text content of the email

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook `SPAM_EMAIL_PREDICTION.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Install required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
   ```
3. Upload or load the dataset (`spam.csv`).
4. Run the notebook step-by-step:
   - Preprocess the text
   - Convert text to numerical features (TF-IDF/CountVectorizer)
   - Train a classifier (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)
   - Evaluate the model
